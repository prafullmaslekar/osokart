            <p>Osokart cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal information only as

                to
                deliver our products, services, websites and mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the
                same, or
                as you have requested (collectively, our “Services”). Your personal information includes information
                such as:

            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but
                also how
                you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information. We’ve also created a <a

            <p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may

                Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at
                privacy@osokart.com. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an

            <strong><strong>What information we collect, how we collect it, and why</strong></strong>

            <p></p>
            <p>Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address,
                    credit
                    card number, government identification);</li>
                <li>request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number, voice
                    recordings);</li>
                <li>complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or</li>
                <li>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we
                    promote that
                    might require information about you.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary
                and
                optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d
                highlight and
                explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> on our websites and mobile applications allow us to
                track your
                browsing behavior, such as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased. Specifically, the data
                collected
                relates to your interactions with our site features or third-party features, such as social media
                plugins,
                contained within the Services; Internet Protocol (IP) address (for example, to determine your language
                preference; browser type and settings; the date and time the Services were used; device type and
                settings;
                operating system used; application IDs, unique device identifiers; and error data). These technologies
                also
                automatically collect data to measure website performance and improve our systems, including metadata,
                log
                files, page load time, server response time to optimize DNS resolution, network routing and server
                configurations. For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize,
